# Algorithms: #

## Tree ##
		1. Balanced Binary search tree and height.
		2. Check if a tree is a BST.
		
## Search ##
		1. BinarySearch
		2. BreadthFirstSearch

## Linked Lists ##
		1. Creating and deleting nodes from a linked list 
		2. Merge two sorted linked lists
## Misc ##

		1. Balanced Parenthesis: Given an expression string exp, write a program to examine whether the pairs 
		   and the orders of �{�,�}�,�(�,�)�,�[�,�]� are correct in exp.
        2. Permutation: Given P(n,r), find all the permutations of n,r. P(n,r) where: P(n,r) = n! / (n - r)!
		3. Combinations: Given C(n,r), find all the combinations of n,r. C(n,r) where: C(n,r) = n!/(r! * (n-r)!)
